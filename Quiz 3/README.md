This is the README file for my JavaScript game. The game required that when you click a start button, a timer starts at which point in time you are presented with a question. Once that questions answered correctly when you're presented within another question. Time is subtracted from the clock. Wthe game ends when all questions answeredo or time expires. The timer reaches the road. The game is over.
